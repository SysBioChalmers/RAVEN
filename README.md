The RAVEN (Reconstruction, Analysis and Visualization of Metabolic Networks) Toolbox 2 is a software suite for Matlab that allows for semi-automated reconstruction of genome-scale models (GEMs). It makes use of published models and/or KEGG, MetaCyc databases, coupled with extensive gap-filling and quality control features. The software suite also contains methods for visualizing simulation results and omics data, as well as a range of methods for performing simulations and analyzing the results. The software is a useful tool for system-wide data analysis in a metabolic context and for streamlined reconstruction of metabolic networks based on protein homology.

> A manuscript describing RAVEN Toolbox 2 is currently being prepared. Citation details will therefore be updated in the near future.
