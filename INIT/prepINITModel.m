% prepINITModel
%
% The purpose of this function is to run time-consuming calculation steps that are not
% dependent on the RNA-Seq data.
%
% origRefModel      The model to use. Expected to be something such as Human-GEM, 
%                   Mouse-GEM, etc.
% taskStruct        The essential tasks. Can be loaded with for example
%                   taskStruct = parseTaskList('../data/metabolicTasks_Essential.txt');
% spontRxnNames     The spontaneous rxns. (opt, default {})
% convertGenes      If true the genes are converted to gene names (from 
%                   ENSEMBL) (opt, default false)
% customRxnsToIgnore These reactions can be ignored in the ignore mask 
%                   (specifying b7=1) (opt, default = {})
% extComp           Name of the external compartment, typically 's' or 'e'. This
%                   is used for identifying exch and import rxns (opt, default = 'e')
% prepData          The resulting prepData structure which is used as input to ftINIT
% skipScaling       If true the scaling step is not run on the minimal model. The 
%                   scaling is there to remove large differences between the 
%                   stoichiometric coefficients within a reaction, since such
%                   differences creates numerical issues in the ftINIT algorithm 
%                   due to limitations in solver resolution. However,
%                   the current scaling step is also risky and may lead to that
%                   some reactions cannot carry flux, since it changes the stoichiometry
%                   of the reactions with large differences. If you experience problems
%                   where the solution is infeasible, it may be worth trying to turn off
%                   the scaling. Note that it is only the minModel that is scaled,
%                   the scaling will not be present in the final model.
%                   Default: (opt, default = false)

    %reactions but in different directions, at least no such cases exist now, so we ignore this for now.

    %Now create a minimal model for the MILP - we want to make this as small as we can, but we
    %don't want to use this later when we create the final models - just for the first MILP.
    %We don't want boundary metabolites in here either.

    %We do a trick with the essential rxns here:
    %What we want is to get rid of the reversibility of the reactions, because reversible reactions require
    %an integer each in the MILP, and we can also get the case that it may be cheaper to force flux in the wrong direction, which 
    %will probably not give the gap-filling of reactions that we want.
    %So, we simply change the reversible reactions to irreversible, and flip their direction if the direction
    %to force flux in is negative. We don't need to do anything else, runINIT will then handle all essential rxns
    %as irreversible (and will not add any integers etc. for them).

    minModel1 = cModel;
    %for the essential rxns where we should force flux in the positive direction, just make them irreversible
    %for the negative direction, we do the same, but also flip the direction of the reaction

    %first flip the reactions with negative direction
    %constructEquations(minModel1,minModel1.rxns(selInd(essentialRevDir))) %looks good
    minModel1 = reverseRxns(minModel1, minModel1.rxns(selInd(essentialRevDir)));

    %Then make them irreversible
    minModel1.rev(selInd) = 0;
    minModel1.lb(selInd) = 0;
else
    minModel1 = cModel;
end
%Now, remove reversibility on any reactions that can only be run in one direction - that simplifies the problem
%This takes a long time to run (at least an hour or so).
%This is an important step, we go from 5533 to 3734 reversible rxns, which reduces the size of the MILP,
%since irreversible rxns are easier to handle.

%we now need to figure out what happened to the essential rxns in the merge step above.
%Note that it would be ideal to run checkTasks on the result from mergeLinear, but that doesn't work.
%The exchange rxns have in many cases been merged with other reactions, making it difficult to run
%the tasks. So, instead we run checkTasks before, and figure out which merged reactions the 
%essential reactions belong to now

%It may be possible to create a minModel2b, run mergeLinear on that (which is quick), and 
%then run checkTasks on the minimized model. Would be good to check if this gives the 
%same result, I'm not sure. The code would get less complicated.
