function [x,I,exitFlag]=ftINITFillGapsMILP(model, toMinimize, params, scores, verbose)
% ftINITFillGapsMILP
%   Returns the minimal set of fluxes that satisfy the model using
%   mixed integer linear programming. This is an optimized variant of the
%   old function "getMinNrFluxes" that is adapted to ftINIT.
%   It does not need to make an irrev model, which takes time. The problem 
%   also becomes smaller (fewer integers but larger matrix). Only tested with 
%   Gurobi.
%
%	model         a model structure
%   toMinimize    either a cell array of reaction IDs, a logical vector
%                 with the same number of elements as reactions in the model,
%                 of a vector of indexes for the reactions that should be
%                 minimized (opt, default model.rxns)
%   params        parameter structure as used by getMILPParams (opt)
%   scores        vector of weights for the reactions. Negative scores
%                 should not have flux. Positive scores are not possible in this
%                 implementation, and they are changed to max(scores(scores<0)).
%                 Must have the same dimension as toMinimize (find(toMinimize)
%                 if it is a logical vector) (opt, default -1 for all reactions)
%   verbose       if true, the MILP progression will be shown. 
%
%   x             the corresponding fluxes for the full model
%   I             the indexes of the reactions in toMinimize that were used
%                 in the solution
%   exitFlag      1: optimal solution found
%                -1: no feasible solution found
%                -2: optimization time out
%
%   NOTE: Uses 1000 mmol/gDW/h as an arbitary large flux. Could possibly
%   cause problems if the fluxes in the model are larger than that.

%The trick to make this possible using a reversible model is that for 
%reversible reactions, we do the following. Set the flux Vi == Vipos - Vineg.
%What happens then is that if the flux is positive, Vipos will have a nonzero value,
%and when the flux is negative, Vineg will have a positive value. In addition
%we can add an arbitrary constant to both Vipos and Vineg. For example, if the
%flux Vi is -1, Vineg can be 4 and Vipos 3. This is however not a problem, 
%because we can be sure that Vineg + Vipos >= abs(Vi). Since we are interested
%in forcing the ints to be on when there is a flux, it doesn't matter if we overestimate
%the flux! So, we can simply constrain the boolean Yi to Yi*Maxflux >= Vineg + Vipos.

%The matrix then becomes as this:
%         S       p n int b     var
%         SSSSSSSS        -
%         SSSSSSSS         -
%         SSSSSSSS          -
%         SSSSSSSS           -
%         SSSSSSSS            -
%         SSSSSSSS             -
%         -       1 -             
%               -  1 -
%           -          M         -
%             -         M         -
%                 - - M         -
%                  - -   M         -
% An example with 8 rxns and 6 metabolites. - means -1, M max flux, and S is the S matrix.
% 4 rxns are to be minimized(1,3,5,7) and 1,7 are reversible. The p and n 
% are the Vipos and Vineg variables (2 rxns of each). The ints are the Yi for
% the variables that are to be minimized (the rest of the rxns doesn't have any).
% The mets here are the constraints, so right under the S matrix, you have
% Vi == Vipos - Vineg for the reactions 1 and 7 while the two next rows represent
% the non-reversible rxns 3 and 5, where we simply say that yi*M >= Vi. The last 
% 2 rows are the reactions yi*M >= Vipos + Vineg. To the right, we first have a
% -I matrix for setting the b constraints, and under that we have rxns that are
% just variables (rxns) between 0 and Inf to complete the constraints mentioned above.
%Ex: yi*M >= Vipos + Vineg is impl. as yi*M - Vipos - Vineg - var == 0, 0 <= var <= Inf.
%
%All rows should be equal to zero, so we don't set the b vector in the problem
%The reactions should be constrained as follows
%S - as given in model.lb and model.ub
%pos and neg - between 0 and inf
%ints - between 0 and 1
%b - as stated in the model.b vector - if this has one column, that is lb and ub (fixed value), if two columns, that is lb and ub
%var - between zero and inf
