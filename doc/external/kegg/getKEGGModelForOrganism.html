   Reconstructs a genome-scale metabolic model based on protein homology
   to the orthologies in KEGG. If the target species is not available in
   KEGG, the user must select a closely related species. It is also
   possible to circumvent protein homology search (see fastaFile parameter
   for more details)

   Input:
   organismID          three or four letter abbreviation of the organism
                       (as used in KEGG). If not available, use a closely
                       related species. This is used for determing the
                       phylogenetic distance. Use 'eukaryotes' or
                       'prokaryotes' to get a model for the whole domain.
                       Only applicable if fastaFile is empty, i.e. no
                       homology search should be performed
   fastaFile           a FASTA file that contains the protein sequences of
                       the organism for which to reconstruct a model (opt,
                       if no FASTA file is supplied then a model is
                       reconstructed based only on the organism
                       abbreviation. This option ignores all settings
                       except for keepSpontaneous, keepUndefinedStoich,
                       keepIncomplete and keepGeneral)
   dataDir             directory for which to retrieve the input data.
                       Should contain a combination of these sub-folders:
                       -dataDir\keggdb
                           The KEGG database files used in 1a (see below)
                       -dataDir\fasta
                           The multi-FASTA files generated in 1b (see
                           below)
                       -dataDir\aligned
                           The aligned FASTA files as generated in 2a (see
                           below)
                       -dataDir\hmms
                           The hidden Markov models as generated in 2b or
                           downloaded from BioMet Toolbox (see below)
                       The final directory in dataDir should be styled as
                       proXXX_keggYY or eukXXX_keggYY, indicating whether
                       the HMMs were trained on pro- or eukaryotic
                       sequences, using a sequence similarity threshold of
                       XXX %, fitting the KEGG version YY. E.g.
                       euk100_kegg82. (opt, see note about fastaFile. Note
                       that in order to rebuild the KEGG model from a
                       database dump, as opposed to using the version
                       supplied with RAVEN, you would still need to supply
                       this)
   outDir              directory to save the results from the quering of
                       the hidden Markov models. The output is specific
                       for the input sequences and the settings used. It
                       is stored in this manner so that the function can
                       continue if interrupted or if it should run in
                       parallel. Be careful not to leave output files from
                       different organisms or runs with different settings
                       in the same folder. They will not be overwritten
                       (opt, default is a temporary dir where all *.out
                       files are deleted before and after doing the
                       reconstruction)
   keepSpontaneous     include reactions labeled as &quot;spontaneous&quot;. (opt,
                       default true)
   keepUndefinedStoich    include reactions in the form n A &lt;=&gt; n+1 A. These
                       will be dealt with as two separate metabolites
                       (opt, default true)
   keepIncomplete      include reactions which have been labelled as
                       &quot;incomplete&quot;, &quot;erroneous&quot; or &quot;unclear&quot; (opt,
                       default true)
   keepGeneral         include reactions which have been labelled as
                       &quot;general reaction&quot;. These are reactions on the form
                       &quot;an aldehyde &lt;=&gt; an alcohol&quot;, and are therefore
                       unsuited for modelling purposes. Note that not all
                       reactions have this type of annotation, and the
                       script will therefore not be able to remove all
                       such reactions (opt, default false)
   cutOff              significance score from HMMer needed to assign
                       genes to a KO (opt, default 10^-50)
   minScoreRatioG      a gene is only assigned to KOs for which the score
                       is &gt;=log(score)/log(best score) for that gene. This
                       is to prevent that a gene which clearly belongs to
                       one KO is assigned also to KOs with much lower
                       scores (opt, default 0.8 (lower is less strict))
   minScoreRatioKO     ignore genes in a KO if their score is
                       &lt;log(score)/log(best score in KO). This is to
                       &quot;prune&quot; KOs which have many genes and where some are
                       clearly a better fit (opt, default 0.3 (lower is
                       less strict))
   maxPhylDist         -1: only use sequences from the same domain
                       (Prokaryota, Eukaryota)
                       other (positive) value: only use sequences for
                       organisms where the phylogenetic distance is at the
                       most this large (as calculated in getPhylDist)
                       (opt, default Inf, which means that all sequences
                       will be used)
   nSequences          for each KO, use up to this many sequences from the
                       most closely related species. This is mainly to
                       speed up the alignment process for KOs with very
                       many genes. This subsampling is performed before
                       running CD-HIT (opt, default inf)
   seqIdentity         sequence identity threshold in CD-HIT, referred as
                       &quot;global sequence identity&quot; in CD-HIT User's Guide.
                       The only possible options are 1 (100 %), 0.9 (90 %)
                       and 0.5 (50 %). If other values are provided,
                       CD-HIT is skipped (opt, default -1, i.e. CD-HIT is
                       skipped)

   Output:
   model               the reconstructed model

   PLEASE READ THIS: The input to this function can be confusing, because
   it is intended to be run in parallel on a cluster or in multiple
   sessions. It therefore saves a lot of intermediate results to storage.
   This also serves the purpose of not having to do redundant
   calculations. This, however, comes with the disadvantage of somewhat
   trickier handling. This is what this function does:

   1a. Loads files from a local KEGG FTP dump and constructs a general
       RAVEN model representing the metabolic network. The functions
       getRxnsFromKEGG, getGenesFromKEGG, getMetsFromKEGG summarise the
       data into 'keggRxns.mat', 'keggGenes.mat' and 'keggMets.mat' files,
       which are later merged into 'keggModel.mat' by getModelFromKEGG
       function. The function getPhylDist generates 'keggPhylDist.mat'
       file. KEGG FTP access requires a &lt;a href=&quot;matlab:
       web('http://www.bioinformatics.jp/en/keggftp.html')&quot;&gt;license&lt;/a&gt;.
   1b. Generates protein FASTA files from the KEGG FTP dump (see 1a). One
       multi-FASTA file for each KO in KEGG is generated.

   The Step 1 has to be re-done every time KEGG updates their database (or
   rather when the updates are large enough to warrant re-running this
   part). Many users would probably never use this feature.

   2a. Filters KO-specific protein sets. This is done by using the
       settings &quot;maxPhylDist&quot; and &quot;nSequences&quot; to control which sequences
       should be used for constructing Hidden Markov models (HMMs), and
       later for matching your sequences to.
       The most common alternatives here would be to use sequences from
       only eukaryotes, only prokaryotes or all sequences in KEGG. As
       explained in the README.md file, various sets of pre-trained hidden
       Markov models are available at &lt;a href=&quot;matlab:
       web('http://biomet-toolbox.chalmers.se/index.php?page=downtools-raven')&quot;&gt;BioMet
       Toolbox&lt;/a&gt;. This is normally the most convenient way, but if you
       would like to use, for example, only fungal sequences for training
       the HMMs then you need to re-run this step.
   2b. KO-specific protein FASTA files are re-organised into
       non-redundant protein sets with CD-HIT. The user can only set
       seqIdentity parameter, which corresponds to '-c' parameter in
       CD-HIT, described as &quot;sequence identity threshold&quot;. The following
       non-default parameter settings are used depending on seqIdentity
       value:
       __________________________________________________________________
       |                           |         seqIdentity value          |
       |                           --------------------------------------
       |                           |  1.0   |  0.9   |  0.5   |    x    |
       | CD-HIT parameters         -------------------------------------|
       -----------------------------------------------------------------|
       | Input Dataset (-i)        | raw    | cdh100 | cdh90  | raw     |
       | Output Dataset (-o)       | cdh100 | cdh90  | cdh50  | cdhOth  |
       | Sequence identity (-c)    | 1.0    | 0.9    | 0.5    | x       |
       | word_length (-n)          | 5      | 5      | 4      | 2-5*    |
       | Max available memory (-M) |               2000                 |
       ------------------------------------------------------------------        
       * - word length depends from sequence identity value (see CD-HIT
       manual for more details)

       The table reads as follows: if seqIdentity is equal to 1, then
       &quot;cdh100&quot; set is produced from raw set of proteins. If seqIdentity
       is equal to 0.9, then &quot;cdh90&quot; is produced from &quot;cdh100&quot; proteins
       set. When seqIdentity is equal to 0.5, &quot;cdh50&quot; is obtained from
       &quot;cdh90&quot; protein set. Finally, if other seqIdentity value is used,
       it is obtained directly from the raw set of proteins.
   2c. Does a multi sequence alignment for multi-FASTA files obtained in
       Step 2b for future use. MAFFT software with automatic selection of
       alignment algorithm is used in this step ('--auto').
   2d. Trains hidden Markov models using HMMer for each of the aligned
       KO-specific FASTA files obtained in Step 2c. This is performed with
       'hmmbuild' using the default settings.

   Step 2 may be reasonable to be re-done if the user wants to tweak the
   settings in proteins filtering, clustering, multi sequence alignment or
   HMMs training steps. However, it requires to have KO-specific protein
   FASTA files obtained in Step 1a. As such files are not provided in
   RAVEN and BioMet ToolBox, the user can only generate these files from
   KEGG FTP dump files, so KEGG FTP license is needed.

   3a. Queries the HMMs with sequences for the organism you are making a
       model for. This step uses both the output from step 1a and from 2d.
       This is done with 'hmmsearch' function under default settings. The
       significance threshold value set in 'cutOff' parameter is used
       later when parsing '*.out' files to filter out KO hits with higher
       value than 'cutOff' value. The results with passable E values are
       summarised into KO-gene occurence matrix with E values in
       intersections as 'koGeneMat'. The parameters 'minScoreRatioG' and
       'minScoreRatioKO' are then applied to 'prune' KO-gene associations
       (see the function descriptions above for more details). The
       intersection values for these 'prunable' associations are converted
       to zeroes.
   3b. Constructs a model based on the pre-processed KO-gene association
       matrix (koGeneMat). As the full KEGG model already has reaction-KO
       relationships, KOs are converted into the query genes. The final
       draft model contains only these reactions, which are associated
       with KOs from koGeneMat. The reactions without the genes may also
       be included, if the user set keepSpontaneous as 'true'.

   The Step 3 is specific to the organism for which the model is
   reconstructed.

   In principle the function looks at which output that is already available
   and runs only the parts that are required for step 3. This means
   that (see the definition of the parameters for details):
   -1a is only performed if there are no KEGG model files in the
   RAVEN\external\kegg directory
   -1b is only performed if not all required HMMs OR aligned FASTA files
   OR multi-FASTA files exist in the defined dataDir. This means that this
   step is skipped if the HMMs are downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead
   (see above). If not all files exist it will try to find
   the KEGG database files in dataDir.
   -2a is only performed if not all required HMMs OR aligned FASTA files
   files exist in the defined dataDir. This means that this step is skipped
   if the HMMs are downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead (see above).
   -2b is only performed if not all required HMMs exist in the defined
   dataDir. This means that this step is skipped if the FASTA files or
   HMMs are downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead (see above).
   -3a is performed for the required HMMs for which no corresponding .out
   file exists in outDir. This is just a way to enable the function to be
   run in parallel or to resume if interrupted.
   -3b is always performed.

   These steps are specific to the organism for which you are
   reconstructing the model.

   Regarding the whole pipeline, the function checks the output that is
   already available and runs only the parts that are required for step 3.
   This means that (see the definition of the parameters for details):
   -1a is only performed if there are no KEGG model files in the
   RAVEN\external\kegg directory.
   -1b is only performed if any of required KOs do not have HMMs, aligned
   FASTA files, clustered FASTA files and raw FASTA files in the defined
   dataDir. This means that this step is skipped if the HMMs are
   downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead (see above). If not all files
   exist it will try to find the KEGG database files in dataDir.
   -2ab are only performed if any of required KOs do not have HMMs,
   aligned FASTA files and clustered FASTA files in the defined dataDir.
   This means that this step is skipped if the HMMs are downloaded from
   BioMet Toolbox instead (see above).
   -2c is only performed if any of required KOs do not have HMMs and
   aligned FASTA files in the defined dataDir. This means that this step
   is skipped if the HMMs are downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead (see
   above).
   -2d is only performed if any of required KOs do not have HMMs exist in
   the defined dataDir. This means that this step is skipped if the FASTA
   files or HMMs are downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead (see above).
   -3a is performed for the required HMMs for which no corresponding .out
   file exists in outDir. This is just a way to enable the function to be
   run in parallel or to resume if interrupted.
   -3b is always performed.

   NOTE: it is also possible to obtain draft model from KEGG without
   providing protein FASTA file for the target organism. In such case the
   organism three-four letter abbreviation set as 'organismID' must exist
   in the local KEGG database. In such case, the program just fetches all
   the reactions, which are associated with given 'organismID'.
