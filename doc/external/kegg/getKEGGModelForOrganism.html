   Reconstructs a genome-scale metabolic model based on protein homology to the
   orthologies in KEGG

   organismID          three or four letter abbreviation of the organism
                       (as used in KEGG). If not available, use a closely
                       related species. This is used for determing the
                       phylogenetic distance. Use 'eukaryotes' or
                       'prokaryotes' to get a model for the whole domain.
                       Only applicable if fastaFile is empty, i.e. no
                       homology search should be performed
   fastaFile           a FASTA file that contains the protein sequences of
                       the organism for which to reconstruct a model (opt,
                       if no FASTA file is supplied then a model is
                       reconstructed based only on the organism
                       abbreviation. This option ignores all settings
                       except for keepUndefinedStoich, keepIncomplete and
                       keepGeneral)
   dataDir             directory for which to retrieve the input data.
                       Should contain a combination of these sub-folders:
                       -dataDir\keggdb
                           The KEGG database files used in 1a (see below)
                       -dataDir\fasta
                           The multi-FASTA files generated in 1b (see
                           below)
                       -dataDir\aligned
                           The aligned FASTA files as generated in 2a (see
                           below)
                       -dataDir\hmms
                           The hidden Markov models as generated in 2b or
                           downloaded from BioMet Toolbox (see below)
                       The final directory in dataDir should be styled as
                       proXXX_keggYY or eukXXX_keggYY, indicating whether
                       the HMMs were trained on pro- or eukaryotic
                       sequences, using a sequence similarity threshold of
                       XXX %, fitting the KEGG version YY. E.g.
                       euk100_kegg82. (opt, see note about fastaFile. Note
                       that in order to rebuild the KEGG model from a
                       database dump, as opposed to using the version
                       supplied with RAVEN, you would still need to supply
                       this)
   outDir              directory to save the results from the quering of
                       the hidden Markov models. The output is specific
                       for the input sequences and the settings used. It
                       is stored in this manner so that the function can
                       continue if interrupted or if it should run in
                       parallel. Be careful not to leave output files from
                       different organisms or runs with different settings
                       in the same folder. They will not be overwritten
                       (opt, default is a temporary dir where all *.out
                       files are deleted before and after doing the
                       reconstruction)
   keepUndefinedStoich    include reactions in the form n A &lt;=&gt; n+1 A. These
                       will be dealt with as two separate metabolites
                       (opt, default true)
   keepIncomplete      include reactions which have been labelled as
                       &quot;incomplete&quot;, &quot;erroneous&quot; or &quot;unclear&quot; (opt,
                       default true)
   keepGeneral         include reactions which have been labelled as
                       &quot;general reaction&quot;. These are reactions on the form
                       &quot;an aldehyde &lt;=&gt; an alcohol&quot;, and are therefore
                       unsuited for modelling purposes. Note that not all
                       reactions have this type of annotation, and the
                       script will therefore not be able to remove all
                       such reactions (opt, default false)
   cutOff              significance score from HMMer needed to assign
                       genes to a KO (opt, default 10^-50)
   minScoreRatioG      a gene is only assigned to KOs for which the score
                       is &gt;=log(score)/log(best score) for that gene. This
                       is to prevent thata gene which clearly belongs to
                       one KO is assigned also to KOs with much lower
                       scores (opt, default 0.8 (lower is less strict))
   minScoreRatioKO     ignore genes in a KO if their score is
                       &lt;log(score)/log(best score in KO). This is to
                       &quot;prune&quot; KOs which havemany genes and where some are
                       clearly a better fit (opt, default 0.3 (lower is
                       less strict))
   maxPhylDist         -1: only use sequences from the same domain
                       (Prokaryota, Eukaryota)
                       other (positive) value: only use sequences for
                       organisms where the phylogenetic distance is at the
                       most this large (as calculated in getPhylDist)
                       (opt, default Inf, which means that all sequences
                       will be used)
   nSequences          for each KO, use up to this many sequences from the
                       most closely related species. This is mainly to
                       speed up the alignment process for KOs with very
                       many genes. This subsampling is performed before
                       running CD-HIT (opt, default inf)
   seqIdentity         sequence identity threshold in CD-HIT, referred as
                       &quot;global sequence identity&quot; in CD-HIT User's Guide.
                       The only possible options are 1 (100 %), 0.9 (90 %)
                       and 0.5 (50 %). If other values are provided,
                       CD-HIT is skipped (opt, default -1, i.e. CD-HIT is
                       skipped)

   model               the reconstructed model

   PLEASE READ THIS: The input to this function can be confusing, because
   it is intended to be run in parallel on a cluster or in multiple
   sessions. It therefore saves a lot of intermediate results to storage.
   This also serves the purpose of not having to do redundant
   calculations. This, however, comes with the disadvantage of somewhat
   trickier handling. This is what this function does:

   1a. Loads files from a local KEGG FTP dump and constructs a general
       RAVEN model representing the metabolic network. KEGG FTP access
       requires a &lt;a href=&quot;matlab:
       web('http://www.bioinformatics.jp/en/keggftp.html')&quot;&gt;license&lt;/a&gt;.
   1b. Generates FASTA files from the KEGG FTP dump (see 1a). One
       multi-FASTA file for each KO in KEGG is generated. Make sure you
       actually need these first, as the parsing is time-consuming (see
       below).

   These steps only have to be re-done every time KEGG updates their
   database (or rather when the updates are large enough to warrant
   rerunning this part). Many user would probably never use this feature.

   2a. Does alignment of the multi-FASTA files for future use. This uses
       the settings &quot;useEvDist&quot; and &quot;nSequences&quot; to control which
       sequences should be used for constructing Hidden Markov models
       (HMMs), and later for matching your sequences to.
   2b. Trains hidden Markov models using HMMer for each of the aligned
       FASTA files.

   The most common alternatives here would be to use sequences from only
   eukaryotes, only prokaryotes or all sequences in KEGG. As explained in
   the README.md file, various sets of pre-trained hidden Markov models are
   available at &lt;a href=&quot;matlab:
   web('http://biomet-toolbox.chalmers.se/index.php?page=downtools-raven')&quot;&gt;BioMet
   Toolbox&lt;/a&gt;. This is normally the most convenient way, but if you would
   like to use, for example, only fungal sequences for training the HMMs
   then you need to run this part.

   3a. Queries the HMMs with sequences for the organism you are making a
       model for. This step uses both the output from step 1a and from 2b.
   3b. Constructs a model based on the fit to the HMMs and the chosen
       parameters.

   These steps are specific to the organism for which you are
   reconstructing the model.

   In principle the function looks at which output that is already available
   and runs only the parts that are required for step 3. This means
   that (see the definition of the parameters for details):
   -1a is only performed if there are no KEGG model files in the
   RAVEN\external\kegg directory
   -1b is only performed if not all required HMMs OR aligned FASTA files
   OR multi-FASTA files exist in the defined dataDir. This means that this
   step is skipped if the HMMs are downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead
   (see above). If not all files exist it will try to find
   the KEGG database files in dataDir.
   -2a is only performed if not all required HMMs OR aligned FASTA files
   files exist in the defined dataDir. This means that this step is skipped
   if the HMMs are downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead (see above).
   -2b is only performed if not all required HMMs exist in the defined
   dataDir. This means that this step is skipped if the FASTA files or
   HMMs are downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead (see above).
   -3a is performed for the required HMMs for which no corresponding .out
   file exists in outDir. This is just a way to enable the function to be
   run in parallel or to resume if interrupted.
   -3b is always performed.
