   This exercise is about creating a model from KEGG, based on protein
   sequences in a FASTA file, and doing some functionality checks on the
   model. The example case is for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This
   tutorial is more of a showcase than the previous four, and its main
   purpose is to serve as a scaffold to reconstruct a GEM for any
   organism.
   This refers to Tutorial 5 from &quot;RAVEN tutorials.docx&quot;</pre></div>
