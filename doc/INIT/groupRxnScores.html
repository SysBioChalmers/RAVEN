<div class="fragment"><pre class="comment"> groupRxnScores
 This function sums up the reaction scores for all reactions that were merged 
 into one by the linear merge.
 
 model          The model with linearly merged rxns.
 origRxnScores  The rxnScores from the model before the linear merge.
 origRxnIds     The rxn ids of the model before the linear merge.
 groupIds       The groupIds vector output from linearMerge.
                There is one integer for each rxn in origRxnIds. 0 means
                the reaction was merged. A non-zero integer means that the
                reaction was merged with all other rxns having the same integer.
 origRxnsToZero A logical vector saying which of the original rxns that should not
                be part of the problem. The way this is solved is that all 
                such reactions have a rxnScore of 0. If any original rxnScore 
                value should be zero (which is very unlikely) it is changed to 0.01.
                If the sum of the rxnScores for a merged rxn becomes zero 
                while some of them are nonzero, the new value will also be 0.01, 
                to distinguish the rxn from rxns with only rxns to zero.
                There are two reasons why we don't want zeros in the reaction 
                scores unless these reactions should be ignored:
                  1) we want to be able to separate those
                  2) it is difficult to handle a zero value in the MILP - 
                     the on/off of such a reaction can be random, so better 
                     to fix it in one direction.</pre></div>
