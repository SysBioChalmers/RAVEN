% solveLP
%   Solves a linear programming problem
%
%   model         a model structure
%   minFlux       determines if a second optimization should be performed
%                 in order to get rid of loops in the flux distribution
%                 0: no such optimization is performed
%                 1: the sum of abs(fluxes) is minimized. This is the
%                 fastest way of getting rid of loops
%                 2: the square of fluxes is minimized. This tends to
%                 distribute fluxes across iso-enzymes, which results in a
%                 larger number of reactions being used
%                 3: the number of fluxes is minimized. This can result
%                 in the flux distributions that are the easiest to
%                 interpret. Note that this optimization can be very slow
