function [genes, fluxes, originalGenes, details]=findGeneDeletions(model,testType,analysisType,refModel,oeFactor)
% findGeneDeletions
%   Deletes genes, optimizes the model, and keeps track of the resulting
%   fluxes. This is used for identifying gene deletion targets.
%
%   model           a model structure
%   testType        single/double gene deletions/over expressions. Over
%                   expression only available if using MOMA
%                   'sgd'   single gene deletion
%                   'dgd'   double gene deletion
%                   'sgo'   single gene over expression
%                   'dgo'   double gene over expression
%   analysisType    determines whether to use FBA ('fba') or MOMA ('moma')
%                   in the optimization
%   refModel        MOMA works by fitting the flux distributions of two
%                   models to be as similar as possible. The most common
%                   application is where you have a reference model where
%                   some of the fluxes are constrained from experimental
%                   data. This model is required when using MOMA
%   oeFactor        a factor by which the fluxes should be increased if a
%                   gene is overexpressed (opt, default 10)
%
%   genes           a matrix with the genes that were deleted in each
%                   optimization (the gene indexes in originalGenes). Each
%                   row corresponds to a column in fluxes
%   fluxes          a matrix with the resulting fluxes. Double deletions
%                   that result in an unsolvable problem have all zero
%                   flux. Single deletions that result in an unsolvable
%                   problem are indicated in details instead
%   originalGenes   simply the genes in the input model. Included for
%                   simple presentation of the output
%   details         not all genes will be deleted in all analyses. It is
%                   for example not necessary to delete genes for dead end
%                   reactions. This is a vector with details about
%                   each gene in originalGenes and why or why not it was
%                   deleted
%                   1: Was deleted
%                   2: Proved lethal in sgd (single gene deletion)
%                   3: Only involved in reactions with too many iso-enzymes
%                   4: Involved in dead-end reaction
%
%   NOTE: This function disregards complexes. Any one gene can encode a
%         reaction even if parts of the complex is deleted.
