% fillGaps
%   Uses template model(s) to fill gaps in a model
%
%   model               a model structure that may contains gaps to be filled
%   models              a cell array of reference models or a model structure.
%                       The gaps will be filled using reactions from these models
%   allowNetProduction  true if net production of all metabolites is
%                       allowed. A reaction can be unable to carry flux because one of
%                       the reactants is unavailable or because one of the
%                       products can't be further processed. If this
%                       parameter is true, only the first type of
%                       unconnectivity is considered (opt, default false)
%   useModelConstraints true if the constraints specified in the model
%                       structure should be used. If false then reactions
%                       included from the template model(s) so that as many
%                       reactions as possible in model can carry flux
%                       (opt, default false)
%   supressWarnings     false if warnings should be displayed (opt, default
%                       false)
%   rxnScores           array with scores for each of the reactions in the
%                       reference model(s). If more than one model is supplied,
%                       then rxnScores should be a cell array of vectors.
%                       The solver will try to maximize the sum of the
%                       scores for the included reactions (opt, default
%                       is -1 for all reactions)
%   params              parameter structure as used by getMILPParams (opt)
%
%   newConnected        cell array with the reactions that could be
%                       connected. This is not calulated if
%                       useModelConstraints is true
%   cannotConnect       cell array with reactions that could not be
%                       connected. This is not calculated if
%                       useModelConstraints is true
%   addedRxns           cell array with the reactions that were added from
%                       "models"
%   newModel            the model with reactions added to fill gaps
%   exitFlag            1: optimal solution found
%                      -1: no feasible solution found
%                      -2: optimization time out
%
%   This method works by merging the model to the reference model(s) and
%   checking which reactions can carry flux. All reactions that can't
%   carry flux are removed (cannotConnect).
%   If useModelConstraints is false it then solves the MILP problem of
%   minimizing the number of active reactions from the reference models
%   that are required to have flux in all the reactions in model. This
%   requires that the input model has exchange reactions present for the
%   nutrients that are needed for its metabolism. If useModelConstraints is
%   true then the problem is to include as few reactions as possible from
%   the reference models in order to satisfy the model constraints.
%   The intended use is that the user can attempt a general gap-filling using
%   useModelConstraint=false or a more targeted gap-filling by setting
%   constraints in the model structure and then use
%   useModelConstraints=true. Say that the user want to include reactions
%   so that all biomass components can be synthesized. He/she could then
%   define a biomass equation and set the lower bound to >0. Running this
%   function with useModelConstraints=true would then give the smallest set
%   of reactions that have to be included in order for the model to produce
%   biomass.
%
