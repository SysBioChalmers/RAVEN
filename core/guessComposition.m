function [model, guessedFor, couldNotGuess]=guessComposition(model, printResults)
% guessComposition
%   Attempts to guess the composition of metabolites without information
%   about elemental composition
%
%   model               a model structure
%   printResults        true if the output should be printed (opt, default true)
%
%   model               a model structure with information about elemental
%                       composition added
%   guessedFor          indexes for the metabolites for which a composition
%                       could be guessed
%   couldNotGuess       indexes for the metabolites for which no
%                       composition could be assigned
%
%   This function works in a rather straight forward manner:
%
%   1. Get the metabolites which lack composition and participates in
%   at least one reaction where all other metabolites have composition information
%   2. Loop through them and calculate their composition based on the rest
%   of the involved metabolites. If there are any inconsistencies, so that
%   a given metabolite should have different composition in different
%   equations, then throw an error
%   3. Go to 1
%
%   This simple approach requires that the rest of the metabolites have
%   correct composition information, and that the involved reactions are
%   correct. The function will exit with an error on any inconsistencies,
%   which means that it could also be used as a way of checking the model
%   for errors. Note that just because this exits sucessfully, the
%   calculated compositions could still be wrong (in case that the existing
%   compositions were wrong)
%
