function scores=analyzeSampling(Tex, df, solutionsA, solutionsB, printResults)
% analyzeSampling
%   Compares the significance of change in flux between two conditions with
%   the significance of change in gene expression
%
%   Tex             a vector of t-scores for the change in gene expression
%                   for each reaction. This score could be the Student t
%                   between the two conditions, or you can calculate it from
%                   a p-value (by computing the inverse of the so called error
%                   function). If you choose the second alternative you should
%                   be aware that the transcripts that increased in expression
%                   level should have positive values and those who decreased
%                   in expression level should have negative values (the
%                   p-values only tell you if the fluxes changed or not but
%                   not in which direction)
%   df              the degrees of freedom in the t-test
%   solutionsA      random solutions for the reference condition (as
%                   generated by randomSampling)
%   solutionsB      random solutions for the test condition (as generated
%                   by randomSampling)
%   printResults    prints the most significant reactions in each category
%                   (opt, default false)
%
%   scores          a Nx3 column matrix with the probabilities of a reaction:
%                   1) changing both in flux and expression in the same direction
%                   2) changing in expression but not in flux
%                   3) changing in flux but not in expression or changing
%                      in opposed directions in flux and expression.
