function [model, deletedRxns, duplicateRxns]=mergeCompartments(model,keepUnconstrained,deleteRxnsWithOneMet,distReverse)
% mergeCompartments
%   Merge all compartments in a model
%
%   model                 a model structure
%   keepUnconstrained     keep metabolites that are unconstrained in a
%                         'unconstrained' compartment. If these are merged the
%                         exchange reactions will most often be deleted (opt,
%                         default false)
%   deleteRxnsWithOneMet  delete reactions with only one metabolite. These
%                         reactions come from reactions such as A[c] + B[c]
%                         => A[m]. In some models hydrogen is balanced around
%                         each membrane with reactions like this (opt,
%                         default false)
%   distReverse           distinguish reactions with same metabolites but
%                         different reversibility as different reactions
%                         (opt, default true)
%
%   model                 a model with all reactions located to one compartment
%   deletedRxns           reactions that were deleted because of only
%                         having one metabolite after merging
%   duplicateRxns         identical reactions that occurred in different
%                         compartments and were deleted because they turned
%                         to be duplicated after merging
%
%   Merges all compartments into one 's' compartment (for 'System'). This can
%   be useful for example to ensure that there are metabolic capabilities to
%   synthesize all metabolites.
%
%   NOTE: If the metabolite IDs reflect the compartment that they are in
%   the IDs may no longer be representative.
