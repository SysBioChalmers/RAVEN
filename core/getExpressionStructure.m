function experiment=getExpressionStructure(fileName)
% getExpressionStructure
%   Loads a representation of an experiment from an Excel file (see
%   comments further down)
%
%   fileName            an Excel representation on an experiment
%
%   experiment          an experiment structure
%       data            matrix with expression values
%       orfs            the corresponding ORFs
%       experiments     the titles of the experiments
%       boundNames      reaction names for the bounds
%       upperBoundaries matrix with the upper bound values
%       fitNames        reaction names for the measured fluxes
%       fitTo           matrix with the measured fluxes
%
%   A very common data set when working with genome-scale metabolic models
%   is that you have measured fermentation data, gene expression data,
%   and some different 'bounds' (for example different carbon sources
%   or genes that are knocked out) in a number of conditions. This function
%   reads an Excel representation of such an experiment.
%   The Excel file must contain three sheets, 'EXPRESSION', 'BOUNDS',
%   'FITTING'. Below are some examples to show how they should be
%   formatted:
%
%   -EXPRESSION
%       ORF	dsm_paa	wisc_paa
%       Pc00e00030	79.80942723	78.14755338
%   Shows the expression of the gene Pc00e00030 under two different
%   conditions (in this case a DSM strain and a Wisconsin strain of P.
%   chrysogenum with PSS in the media)
%
%   -BOUNDS
%       Fixed Upper	dsm_paa	wisc_paa
%       paaIN	0.1	0.2
%   The upper bound for the reaction paaIN should be 0.1 for the first
%   condition and 0.2 for the second
%
%   -FITTING
%       Fit to	dsm_paa	wisc_paa
%       co2OUT	2.85	3.05
%       glcIN   1.2     0.9
%   The measured fluxes for CO2 production and glucose uptake for the two
%   conditions. The model(s) can later be fitted to match these values as
%   good as possible.

%Loads the experimental data to fit to
[discard,dataSheet]=xlsread(fileName,fitSheet);

%Check to see that the dimensions are correct
if length(experiment.orfs)~=size(experiment.data,1) || (length(experiment.experiments)~=size(experiment.data,2) && ~isempty(experiment.data))
