function [S, mets, badRxns, reversible]=constructS(equations,mets,rxns)
% constructS
%   Constructs a stoichiometric matrix from a cell array of equations
%
%   equations   cell array of equations on the form 'A + 2 B <=> or => 3 C'
%   mets        cell array of metabolites. All metabolites in the equations
%               must be present in the list (opt, default generated from the equations)
%   rxns        cell array of reaction ids. This is only used for printing
%               reaction ids instead of equations in warnings/errors (opt,
%               default [])
%
%
%   S           the resulting stoichiometric matrix
%   mets        cell array with metabolites that corresponds to the order in
%               the S matrix
%   badRxns     boolean vector with the reactions that have one or more
%               metabolites as both substrate and product. An example would be
%               the phosphotransferase ATP + ADP <=> ADP + ATP. In the
%               stoichiometric matrix this equals to an empty reaction which
%               can be problematic
%   reversible  boolean vector with true if the equation is reversible
%
%   Usage: [S, mets, badRxns, reversible]=constructS(equations,mets)
