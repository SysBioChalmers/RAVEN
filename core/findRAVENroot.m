function [ravenPath, prevDir] = findRAVENroot()
% findRAVENroot
%   Finds the root of the RAVEN directory, by searching for the path to
%   RAVEN2.png. Can also record the current directory, in case a function will
%   use the ravenPath to navigate to a precise folder, and it should return to
%   the previous directory afterwards. See e.g. optimizeProb calling glpk.
