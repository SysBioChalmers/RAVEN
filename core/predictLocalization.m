% predictLocalization
%   Tries to assign reactions to compartments in a manner that is in
%   agreement with localization predictors while at the same time
%   maintaining connectivity.

%   model                 a model structure. If the model contains several
%                         compartments they will be merged
%   GSS                   gene scoring structure as from parseScores
%   defaultCompartment    transport reactions are expressed as diffusion
%                         between the defaultCompartment and the others.
%                         This is usually the cytosol. The default
%                         compartment must have a match in
%                         GSS
%   transportCost         the cost for including a transport reaction. If this
%                         a scalar then the same cost is used for all metabolites.
%                         It can also be a vector of costs with the same dimension
%                         as model.mets. Note that negative costs will result in that
%                         transport of the metabolite is encouraged (opt, default 0.5)
%   maxTime               maximum optimization time in minutes (opt,
%                         default 15)
%   plotResults           true if the result should be plotted during the
%                         optimization (opt false)
%
%   outModel              the resulting model structure
%   geneLocalization      structure with the genes and their resulting
%                         localization
%   transportStruct       structure with the transport reactions that had
%                         to be inferred and between which compartments
%   scores                structure that contains the total score history
%                         together with the score based on gene localization
%                         and the score based on included transport reactions
%   removedRxns           cell array with the reaction ids that had to be
%                         removed in order to have a connected input model
%
%   This function requires that the starting network is connected when it's in
%   one compartment. Reactions that are unconnected are removed and saved
%   in removedRxns. Try running fillGaps to have a more connected input
%   model if there are many such reactions.
%
%   In the final model all metabolites are produced in at least one reaction.
%   This doesn't guarantee a fully functional model since there can be internal
%   loops. Transport reactions are only included as passive diffusion (A <=> B).
%
%   The score of a model is the sum of scores for all genes in their
%   assigned compartment minus the cost of all transport reactions that
%   had to be included. A gene can only be assigned to one compartment.
%   This is a simplification to keep the problem size down. The problem is
%   solved using simulated annealing.
