function [newModel, removedRxns]=removeBadRxns(model,rxnRules,ignoreMets,isNames,balanceElements,refModel,ignoreIntBounds,printReport)
% removeBadRxns
%   Iteratively removes reactions which enable production/consumption of some
%   metabolite without any uptake/excretion
%
%   model                   a model structure. For the intented function,
%                           the model shouldn't allow for any uptake/excretion.
%                           The easiest way to achieve this is to import the
%                           model using importModel('filename',false)
%   rxnRules                1: only remove reactions which are unbalanced
%                           2: also remove reactions which couldn't be checked for
%                           mass balancing
%                           3: all reactions can be removed
%                           (opt, default 1)
%   ignoreMets              either a cell array of metabolite IDs, a logical vector
%                           with the same number of elements as metabolites in the model,
%                           of a vector of indexes for metabolites to exclude from
%                           this analysis (opt, default [])
%   isNames                 true if the supplied mets represent metabolite names
%                           (as opposed to IDs). This is a way to delete
%                           metabolites in several compartments at once without
%                           knowing the exact IDs. This only works if ignoreMets
%                           is a cell array (opt, default false)
%   balanceElements         a cell array with the elements for which to
%                           balance the reactions. May contain any
%                           combination of the elements defined in parseFormulas
%                           (opt, default {'C';'P';'S';'N';'O'})
%   refModel                a reference model which can be used to ensure
%                           that the resulting model is still functional.
%                           The intended use is that the reference model is
%                           a copy of model, but with uptake/excretion allowed and
%                           some objectives (such as production of biomass)
%                           constrained to a non-zero flux. Before a
%                           reaction is removed from "model" the function first
%                           checks that the same deletion in "refModel"
%                           doesn't render the problem unfeasible (opt)
%   ignoreIntBounds         true if internal bounds (including reversibility)
%                           should be ignored. Exchange reactions are not affected.
%                           This can be used to find unbalanced solutions which are
%                           not possible using the default constraints (opt,
%                           default false)
%   printReport             true if a report should be printed (opt,
%                           default false)
%
%   newModel               	a model structure after the problematic
%                           reactions have been deleted
%   removedRxns             a cell array with the reactions that were
%                           removed
%
%   The purpose of this function is to remove reactions which enable
%   production/consumption of metabolites even when exchange reactions aren't used.
%   Many models, especially if they are automatically inferred from
%   databases, will have unbalanced reactions which allow for
%   net-production/consumption of metabolites without any consumption/excretion.
%   A common reason for this is when general compounds have different meaning
%   in different reactions (as DNA has in these two reactions).
%       dATP + dGTP + dCTP + dTTP <=> DNA + 4 PPi
%       0.25 dATP + 0.25 dGTP + 0.25 dCTP + 0.25 dTTP <=> DNA + PPi
%   Reactions that are problematic like this are always elementally
%   unbalanced, but it is not always that you would like to exclude all
%   unbalanced reactions from your model.
%   This function tries to remove as few problematic reactions as possible
%   so that the model cannot produce/consume anything from nothing. This is done by
%   repeatedly calling makeSomething/consumeSomething, checking if any of
%   the involved reactions are elementally unbalanced, remove one of them,
%   and then iterating until no metabolites can be produced/consumed.
%   makeSomething is called before consumeSomething.
