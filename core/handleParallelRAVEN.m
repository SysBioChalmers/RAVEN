function [ps, oldPoolAutoCreate] = parallelPoolRAVEN(runParallel)
% handleParallelRAVEN
%   Called by RAVEN functions that support parallel processing, to confirm
%   whether the MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox is installed.
%   - The toolbox is installed, and runParallel == true, ==> a parallel
%     pool is started.
%   - The toolbox is installed, but runParallel == false, ==> the auto-
%     creation of a parallel pool is disabled, to prevent "parfor" in
%     the target function to start a pool anyway.
%   - The toolbox is not installed, and runParallel == true, ==> a warning
%     is displayed that parallel computer is not possible.
%   - The toolbox is not installed, and runParallel == false, ==> the
%     target runs as intended, as "parfor" will automatically run in serial
%     mode instead.
%
% Input:
%   runParallel         logical, whether the target function (which calls
%                       parallelPoolRAVEN) should be run in parallel (opt,
%                       default true)
%
% Output:
%   ps                  parallel settings structure that will be used by
%                       the target function    
%   oldPoolAutoCreate   logical, to reset the original ps.Pool.AutoCreate
%                       setting once the target function has finished
%
% Use: [ps, oldPoolAutoCreate] = parallelPoolRAVEN(runParallel)
