% getKEGGModelForOrganism
%   Reconstructs a genome-scale metabolic model based on protein homology
%   to the orthologies in KEGG. If the target species is not available in
%   KEGG, the user must select a closely related species. It is also
%   possible to circumvent protein homology search (see fastaFile parameter
%   for more details)
%
%   Input:
%   organismID          three or four letter abbreviation of the organism
%                       (as used in KEGG). If not available, use a closely

%                       phylogenetic distance. Use 'eukaryotes' or
%                       'prokaryotes' to get a model for the whole domain.

%                       reactions have this type of annotation, and the

%                       is to prevent that a gene which clearly belongs to

%                       (opt, default empty, global model is loaded by

%
%   PLEASE READ THIS: The input to this function can be confusing, because
%   it is intended to be run in parallel on a cluster or in multiple
%   sessions. It therefore saves a lot of intermediate results to storage.
%   This also serves the purpose of not having to do redundant
%   calculations. This, however, comes with the disadvantage of somewhat
%   trickier handling. This is what this function does:
%
%   1a. Loads files from a local KEGG FTP dump and constructs a general
%       RAVEN model representing the metabolic network. The functions
%       getRxnsFromKEGG, getGenesFromKEGG, getMetsFromKEGG summarise the
%       data into 'keggRxns.mat', 'keggGenes.mat' and 'keggMets.mat' files,
%       which are later merged into 'keggModel.mat' by getModelFromKEGG
%       function. The function getPhylDist generates 'keggPhylDist.mat'
%       file. KEGG FTP access requires a <a href="matlab:
%       web('http://www.bioinformatics.jp/en/keggftp.html')">license</a>.
%   1b. Generates protein FASTA files from the KEGG FTP dump (see 1a). One
%       multi-FASTA file for each KO in KEGG is generated.
%
%   The Step 1 has to be re-done every time KEGG updates their database (or
%   rather when the updates are large enough to warrant re-running this
%   part). Many users would probably never use this feature.
%
%   2a. Filters KO-specific protein sets. This is done by using the
%       settings "maxPhylDist" and "nSequences" to control which sequences
%       should be used for constructing Hidden Markov models (HMMs), and
%       later for matching your sequences to.
%       The most common alternatives here would be to use sequences from
%       only eukaryotes, only prokaryotes or all sequences in KEGG, but you
%       could also play around with the parameters to use e.g. only fungal
%       sequences.
%   2b. KO-specific protein FASTA files are re-organised into
%       non-redundant protein sets with CD-HIT. The user can only set
%       seqIdentity parameter, which corresponds to '-c' parameter in
%       CD-HIT, described as "sequence identity threshold". CD-HIT suggsted
%       sequence identity specific word_length (-n) parameters are used.
%   2c. Does a multi sequence alignment for multi-FASTA files obtained in
%       Step 2b for future use. MAFFT software with automatic selection of
%       alignment algorithm is used in this step ('--auto').
%   2d. Trains hidden Markov models using HMMer for each of the aligned
%       KO-specific FASTA files obtained in Step 2c. This is performed with
%       'hmmbuild' using the default settings.
%
%   Step 2 may be reasonable to be re-done if the user wants to tweak the
%   settings in proteins filtering, clustering, multi sequence alignment or
%   HMMs training steps. However, it requires to have KO-specific protein
%   FASTA files obtained in Step 1a. As such files are not provided in
%   RAVEN and BioMet ToolBox, the user can only generate these files from
%   KEGG FTP dump files, so KEGG FTP license is needed.
%
%   3a. Queries the HMMs with sequences for the organism you are making a
%       model for. This step uses both the output from step 1a and from 2d.
%       This is done with 'hmmsearch' function under default settings. The
%       significance threshold value set in 'cutOff' parameter is used
%       later when parsing '*.out' files to filter out KO hits with higher
%       value than 'cutOff' value. The results with passable E values are
%       summarised into KO-gene occurence matrix with E values in
%       intersections as 'koGeneMat'. The parameters 'minScoreRatioG' and
%       'minScoreRatioKO' are then applied to 'prune' KO-gene associations
%       (see the function descriptions above for more details). The
%       intersection values for these 'prunable' associations are converted
%       to zeroes.
%   3b. Constructs a model based on the pre-processed KO-gene association
%       matrix (koGeneMat). As the full KEGG model already has reaction-KO
%       relationships, KOs are converted into the query genes. The final
%       draft model contains only these reactions, which are associated
%       with KOs from koGeneMat. The reactions without the genes may also
%       be included, if the user set keepSpontaneous as 'true'.
%
%   The Step 3 is specific to the organism for which the model is
%   reconstructed.
%
%   In principle the function looks at which output that is already available
%   and runs only the parts that are required for step 3. This means
%   that (see the definition of the parameters for details):
%   -1a is only performed if there are no KEGG model files in the
%   RAVEN\external\kegg directory
%   -1b is only performed if not all required HMMs OR aligned FASTA files
%   OR multi-FASTA files exist in the defined dataDir. This means that this
%   step is skipped if the HMMs are downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead
%   (see above). If not all files exist it will try to find
%   the KEGG database files in dataDir.
%   -2a is only performed if not all required HMMs OR aligned FASTA files
%   files exist in the defined dataDir. This means that this step is skipped
%   if the HMMs are downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead (see above).
%   -2b is only performed if not all required HMMs exist in the defined
%   dataDir. This means that this step is skipped if the FASTA files or
%   HMMs are downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead (see above).
%   -3a is performed for the required HMMs for which no corresponding .out
%   file exists in outDir. This is just a way to enable the function to be
%   run in parallel or to resume if interrupted.
%   -3b is always performed.
%
%   These steps are specific to the organism for which you are
%   reconstructing the model.
%
%   Regarding the whole pipeline, the function checks the output that is
%   already available and runs only the parts that are required for step 3.
%   This means that (see the definition of the parameters for details):
%   -1a is only performed if there are no KEGG model files in the
%   RAVEN\external\kegg directory.
%   -1b is only performed if any of required KOs do not have HMMs, aligned
%   FASTA files, clustered FASTA files and raw FASTA files in the defined
%   dataDir. This means that this step is skipped if the HMMs are
%   downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead (see above). If not all files
%   exist it will try to find the KEGG database files in dataDir.
%   -2ab are only performed if any of required KOs do not have HMMs,
%   aligned FASTA files and clustered FASTA files in the defined dataDir.
%   This means that this step is skipped if the HMMs are downloaded from
%   BioMet Toolbox instead (see above).
%   -2c is only performed if any of required KOs do not have HMMs and
%   aligned FASTA files in the defined dataDir. This means that this step
%   is skipped if the HMMs are downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead (see
%   above).
%   -2d is only performed if any of required KOs do not have HMMs exist in
%   the defined dataDir. This means that this step is skipped if the FASTA
%   files or HMMs are downloaded from BioMet Toolbox instead (see above).
%   -3a is performed for the required HMMs for which no corresponding .out
%   file exists in outDir. This is just a way to enable the function to be
%   run in parallel or to resume if interrupted.
%   -3b is always performed.
%
%   NOTE: it is also possible to obtain draft model from KEGG without
%   providing protein FASTA file for the target organism. In such case the
%   organism three-four letter abbreviation set as 'organismID' must exist
%   in the local KEGG database. In such case, the program just fetches all
%   the reactions, which are associated with given 'organismID'.
